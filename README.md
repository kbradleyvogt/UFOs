# UFO Sightings 

## Overview 

The purpsoe of the website is to cataloge UFO sightings and allow users to dynamically filter of one or more criteria to get a specific data set for review. 

## Results 

When a user arrives to the webpage they will see an unfiltered verion of the table. To the left is a "Filter Table" column that contains five unique filter options based on the dataset; date, city, state, country and shape. Each filter contains an example of whoa to input for those fields. 

The user then enters one or more desired fitler to review a subset of the data. The can clear the filter(s) and filter again or refresh the page to return to the full dataset.

The screen shot below shows the data filtered on the following criteria:
- Date = 1/4/2010
- State = CA


## Summary

The current website is a great step in the direction of public transparency. It provides data to the public and gives them tools to begin analyzing. A draw back of the current site is it only allows one value per serach filed. Making it impossible to search on a date range or for two or more shapes. Additionally, the dataset itself has not been updated nor has the data been cleaned for easy of use, for example states and cities are not capitalized.

### Recommendations
- Update the date filter to accomendate a date range.
- Update the shape filter to a multi-select dropdown list.
